Here is a repository of my coding projects in school or personal projects.

CPTS223:

  Line Editor:
      Simple line editor written in C++.
      Displays file contents to the console with a '>' symbol denoting current line. The program prompts the user for commands: (Insert, Append, Jump, Save, Quit, List, Delete).
      When the program starts, it gives directions for new users.
      
  AVL Tree: 
      My implimentation of a Templated AVL Tree written in C++.
      Impliments base operations for the tree: (Insert, Remove, Search, GetSize). Written using generic programming, works with all datatypes including objects.
      
  B-Tree:
      My implimentation of a Templated B-Tree written in C++.
      Impliments base operations for the tree: (Insert, Remove, Search, GetSize). Written using generic programming, works with all datatypes including objects.
      
  Huffman-Tree:
      My implimentation of a Huffman Tree written in C++.
      This program uses huffman encoding to encrypt text messages as binary. FIXME: DOES NOT OUTPUT TO BINARY FILE SO COMPRESSION IS NOT PRESENT.
      
CPTS224:

  Misc GoLang Code:
      A few small programs written in GoLang.
      
  Misc Perl Code:
      A few small programs written in Perl.
      
CPTS260:

  Rational:
      A simple rational math calculator written in MIPS32 Assembly language.
      Impliments the four basic operations: (Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication).
      
  Collatz:
      A program that simulates the Collatz Conjecture written in MIPS32 Assembly language.
      Recieves an integer input from the user and tests it against the collatz conjecture.
      
  Palindrome:
      A program that tests a txt file for possible palindromes and prints out a list of all palidromes found.

CPTS360:
  Examples of System Programming. This folder contains examples of my system programming experience. They showcase my ability to create programs that interface with the internal system files.

CPTS427:

  MD5 Salt Decryption:
    A program that searches a password file and brute forces a specified line to find the salt.
    This isn't very efficient, but most brute force programs aren't. TO DO: ALLOW FOR USER INPUT.
  Cryptography:
    A program that uses cryptography to analyze an encrypted message and decrypt it.
