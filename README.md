Here is a repository of my coding projects in school or personal projects.

  Line Editor:
      Simple line editor written in C++.
      Displays file contents to the console with a '>' symbol denoting current line. The program prompts the user for commands: (Insert, Append, Jump, Save, Quit, List, Delete).
      When the program starts, it gives directions for new users.
  AVL Tree: 
      My implimentation of a Templated AVL Tree written in C++.
      Impliments base operations for the tree: (Insert, Remove, Search, GetSize). Written using generic programming, works with all datatypes including objects.
  B-Tree:
      My implimentation of a Templated B-Tree written in C++.
      Impliments base operations for the tree: (Insert, Remove, Search, GetSize). Written using generic programming, works with all datatypes including objects.
  Huffman-Tree:
      My implimentation of a Huffman Tree written in C++.
      This program uses huffman encoding to encrypt text messages as binary. FIXME: DOES NOT OUTPUT TO BINARY FILE SO COMPRESSION IS NOT PRESENT.
CPTS224:
  Misc GoLang Code:
      A few small programs written in GoLang.
  Misc Perl Code:
      A few small programs written in Perl.
CPTS260:
  Rational:
      A simple rational math calculator written in MIPS32 Assembly language.
      Impliments the four basic operations: (Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication).
  Collatz:
      A program that simulates the Collatz Conjecture written in MIPS32 Assembly language.
      Recieves an integer input from the user and tests it against the collatz conjecture.
  Palindrome:
      A program that tests a txt file for possible palindromes and prints out a list of all palidromes found.
