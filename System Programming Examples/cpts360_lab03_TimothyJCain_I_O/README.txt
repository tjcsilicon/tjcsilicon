Timothy J Cain Lab03 Raw_copy data trend:

The trend in data show that as buffer size
increases, the time it takes to run the program
decreases. My graph of this had consistant drop 
until about 2^8 where it leveled off before going 
slightly up again at 2^13 and 2^14, but that could 
just be due to chance. 

The runtime also seemed to be halved every time
buffer_size was increased. from 69s to 35 to 18 and so on.
